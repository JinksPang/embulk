We love your contributions! Before making a Pull Request, please read and follow this contribution guideline.

By contributing your code and/or statements in the Embulk repository, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).


Coding Style
-------------

Our Java code would follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) except for the following points:

* +4 spaces for block indentation.
* 120 characters as a column limit.


Commit Messages
----------------

Commits in the Embulk repository would basically follow [Git's Commit Guidelines](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project) except for some points. Our guideline is summarized that:

* Start your commit message with a single line that describes the changeset concisely.
* Leave the second line blank, followed by a more detailed explanation from the third line.
* Have your motivation for the change, and contrast its implementation with previous behavior.
* Keep every line not so long. 100 characters are acceptable, but worth considering to shorten.
* Use imperative present tense in your commit messages, especially in the first line.
